This code is the operating system files for the ECUHost open automotive operating system. The first release is for Kinetis MK60, future revisions will be incorporate other ARM Cortex micros.
The code compiles to a monolithic kernel that provides all of the services needed for an automotive controller such as timers, analog I/O, comms, memory, RT tasks, threads, etc.
The application code resides in a seperate project. The interraction between application code and kernel is via system calls, pointers to shared data and callbacks. This project was compiled in Keil UV4 for MK60.
